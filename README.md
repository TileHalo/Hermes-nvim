Attempt to integrate email in neovim. This is vaporware and will be for a while.

##Motivation
I want a method to read my mail easily from vim. I spend most of my time in neovim, I even use fish from inside it.
Thus I have [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) open all the time. And possible integration with it and using
neovim's asynchronous plugin api diminishes possible slowdowns in neovim. All I need to do is to represent lot of text in neovim.
That is easy and quick task.
